## Repo organization

This repo is not a standard software git repository, with one branch building the latest-and-greatest version of the software.

Instead, this repo is organized as a series of stand-alone project folders.

Each project folder includes a README file that describes how to get started using the project.

## Getting Help

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/AquaticInformatics/Examples/wiki) for an outline of the example projects.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
