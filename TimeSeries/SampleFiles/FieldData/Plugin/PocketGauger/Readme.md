# Sample Pocket Gauger field data file

AQUARIUS Time-Series can import field data from files exported from the Pocket Gauger software suite.

## AQUARIUS location identifiers

The `<SITE_ID>` XML node inside the `GF_GAUGING_SUMMARY.xml` file of the ZIP archive should contain the AQUARIUS location identifier in order to support automatic upload from Springboard.

If the file does not contain an AQUARIUS location identifier, you can import the file into a specific location using the Location Manager upload page.
