# Sample AquaCalc field data file

AQUARIUS Time-Series can import field data from AquaCalc Pro files.

## AQUARIUS location identifiers

The `Gage ID:` field should contain the AQUARIUS location identifier in order to support automatic upload from Springboard.

If the file does not contain an AQUARIUS location identifier, you can import the file into a specific location using the Location Manager upload page.

## File extensions

AquaCalc files must have a `.csv` file extension, otherwise AQUARIUS will not attempt to parse the file as an AquaCalc measurement.

## Sample file
