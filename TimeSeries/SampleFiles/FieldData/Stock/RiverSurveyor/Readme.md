# Sample RiverSurveyor field data file

AQUARIUS Time-Series can import field data from SonTek RiverSurveyor discharge report files.

## AQUARIUS location identifiers

One of the `Station Number;`, `Location;`, or `Site Name;` fields should contain the AQUARIUS location identifier in order to support automatic upload from Springboard.

If the file does not contain an AQUARIUS location identifier, you can import the file into a specific location using the Location Manager upload page.

## File extensions

RiverSurveyor files must have a `.dis` file extension, otherwise AQUARIUS will not attempt to parse the file as a RiverSurveyor measurement.
